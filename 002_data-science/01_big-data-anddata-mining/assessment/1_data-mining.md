1. **Principal Component Analysis** is example of data reduction algorithm
2. After data is appropriately processed, transformed, and stored, it is subject to data mining.
   - This step covers data analysis methods, including parametric and non-parametric methods, and machine-learning algorithms.
   - A good starting point for data mining is data visualization.
3.  Formal evaluation could include testing the predictive capabilities of the models on observed data to see how effective and efficient the algorithms have been in reproducing data. This is known as an **“in-sample forecast”**
4.  Data mining and evaluating the results becomes an iterative process such that the analysts use better and improved algorithms to improve the quality of results generated in light of the feedback received from the key stakeholders
