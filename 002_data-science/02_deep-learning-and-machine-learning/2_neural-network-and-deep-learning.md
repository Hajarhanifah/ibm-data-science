# NEURAL NETWORK
- Neural networks have been around for decades, They were abandoned for some time because they were computationally very expensive.
- So 20-23 years ago, a neural network would have some inputs that would come in. T
- They would be fed into different processing nodes that would then do some transformation on them and aggregate them or something, and then maybe go to another level of nodes.
-  finally there would some output would come out, and  training a neural network to
  -  recognize digits,
  -  handwritten digits and stuff.
-  neural network is trying to use computer --> a computer program that will mimic how neurons, how our brains use neurons to process thing, neurons and synapses and building these complex networks that can be trained


# DEEP LEARNING
- multiple layers of neural networks, using lots of computing power to solve the problem
- need Graphics Processing Units because it takes enormous amount of matrix and linear algebra calculations to actually do all of the mathematics that you need in neural networks.
- Deep learning, particularly needs really high-powered computational power.
  
# NEURAL NETWORK + DEEP LEARNING
- can recognize speech,
- can recognize people,
- getting your face recognized
-
