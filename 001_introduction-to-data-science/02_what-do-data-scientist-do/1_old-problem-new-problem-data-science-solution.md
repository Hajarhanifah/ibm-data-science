- Organizations can leverage the almost unlimited amount of data now available to them in a growing number of ways
- organization use data for some reason 
    - to discover optimum solutions to existing problems
    - How data scoence use providing innovative solutions for old problem --> ex. Uber
        - Collect real-time user data --> discover how many drivers are available
        - uses data to put the right number of drivers in the right place, at the right time, for a cost the rider is willing to pay
-  Using data science tools and analysis, they have:
    - Gathered data to better understand streetcar operations,
    - identify areas for interventions Analyzed customer complaints data,
    - Used probe data to better understand traffic performance on main routes
    - created a team to better capitalize on big data for both planning, operations and evaluation By focusing on peak hour clearances and identifying the most congested routes, monthly hours lost for commuters due to traffic congestion dropped from 4.75 hrs
- How do you get a better solution that is efficient?
    - Identify the problem and establish a clear understanding of it.
    - Gather the data for analysis.
    - Identify the right tools to use, and develop a data strategy.
    - Case studies are also helpful in customizing a potential solution.
    - Once these conditions exist and available data is extracted, you can develop a machine learning model.
- It will take time for an organization to refine best practices for data strategy using data science, but the benefits are worth it.
