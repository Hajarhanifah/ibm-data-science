  - deploy the analytics and storage capacities of advanced machines that do not necessarily have to be in our machine / company's machine
  - Cloud allows us to not just to store large amounts of data on servers somewhere --> also allows ua to deploy very advanced computing algorithms and and ability to do high-performance computing that are not yours
  - information and algorithms on very large datasets--> send to storage space (cloud)
  - allows multiple entities to work with same data at the same time.
  - enables to get instant access to open source technologies like Apache Spark without the need to install and configure them locally.
  - gives an  access to the most up-to-date tools and libraries without the worry of maintaining them and ensuring that they are up to date
