-   Good data scientists are curious people who ask questions to clarify the business need.
    - "what data do we need to solve the problem, and where will that data come from?".
- Data scientists can

    - Using multiple models to explore the data reveals patterns and outliers;
    - sometimes, this will confirm what the organization suspects, but sometimes it will be completely new knowledge, leading the organization to a new approach.
    - When the data has revealed its insights, the role of the data scientist becomes that of a storyteller, communicating the results to the project stakeholders
    - use powerful data visualization tools to help stakeholders understand the nature of the results, and the recommended action to take. Data Science is changing the way we work
